\begin{abstract}
  In the last years, the field of service oriented computing (SOC) has received a growing interest from researchers and practitioners, particularly with respect to quality of service (QoS). This paper presents a mapping study to aggregate literature in this field in order to find trends and research opportunities in the regarding QoS in SOC. We analysed 250 papers and we were able to identify 3 major groups that have contributed to different aspects in the context of our study. We also show that, with respect to SOC contributions dealing with QoS properties, most of them concentrate on runtime issues, such as monitoring and adaptation. Regarding quality attributes, a vast majority the papers use generic models, so that the proposed solutions are independent of the particularities of a quality attribute. In spite of that, we find that availability and performance were the major highlights. With respect to research type, most of the reviewed studies propose new solutions, instead of evaluating and validating existing proposals--- a symptom of a field that does not follow established research paradigms.
